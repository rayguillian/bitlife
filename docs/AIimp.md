🎯 What Should Be AI-Generated vs Pre-Built
❌ DON'T Use AI For:
Basic Game Mechanics:

Stat calculations (health, money, age progression)
Simple random events ("You got a cold", "Your car broke down")
Basic choice outcomes (Study hard → Intelligence +1)
UI text, buttons, menus
Template-based events with variable substitution

Example Template (No AI needed):
json{
  "event": "job_interview",
  "text": "You have an interview at {company_name} for a {job_title} position.",
  "choices": [
    {"text": "Arrive early and prepared", "effect": "confidence +2"},
    {"text": "Wing it", "effect": "random_outcome"}
  ]
}
✅ DO Use AI For:
Dynamic Storytelling:

Personalizing event descriptions based on your history
NPC dialogue that reflects relationship history
Unique scenario creation when template events get stale
Mystery/plot thread generation
Complex consequence narratives

Example AI Call:
javascript// Only when you need personalized narrative
const prompt = `Write a job interview scene for ${playerName}, a ${age}-year-old ${profession} 
with traits: ${traits}. They're interviewing at ${company} and previously ${recentHistory}. 
The interviewer remembers them from ${pastConnection}.`
🏗️ Smart Hybrid Architecture
Tier 1: Templates (90% of gameplay)
javascript// Fast, cheap, predictable
const basicEvents = {
  school: [...], 
  work: [...], 
  relationships: [...],
  random: [...]
}
Tier 2: AI Enhancement (8% of gameplay)
javascript// When templates get repetitive or need personalization
if (playerHasSeenEventType > 3 || hasComplexHistory) {
  generateAIVariation(templateEvent, playerContext)
}
Tier 3: Pure AI Generation (2% of gameplay)
javascript// For special moments, mysteries, or unique scenarios
if (isSpecialBirthday || mysteryThreadActive || playerRequestsCreativity) {
  generateUniqueScenario(fullPlayerHistory)
}
💰 Cost/Performance Benefits
Template System:

⚡ Instant response
💰 $0 per event
🔄 100% reliable

AI-Enhanced:

⚡ 1-2 second response
💰 ~$0.01 per call
🔄 95% reliable

Pure AI:

⚡ 3-5 second response
💰 ~$0.05 per call
🔄 90% reliable

🧠 NPC Memory: Hybrid Approach
Store Simple Facts (No AI):
json{
  "npcId": "sarah_123",
  "memories": [
    {"event": "player_helped_with_homework", "emotion": "grateful", "strength": 8},
    {"event": "player_forgot_birthday", "emotion": "hurt", "strength": 6}
  ]
}
Generate AI Response Only When Interacting:
javascript// Only when player talks to Sarah
const aiPrompt = `Sarah remembers you helped her with homework (she felt grateful) 
but also that you forgot her birthday (she felt hurt). How does she greet you?`
🎮 Practical Implementation
Start Simple:

Build with templates first
Add AI enhancement gradually
Track which events feel repetitive
Strategically add AI where it has most impact

Example Flow:

Player goes to school → Template event
Player talks to friend → Check relationship history → AI dialogue if complex, template if simple
Player makes major life choice → AI generates personalized consequence narrative

This approach gives you the innovation of AI while keeping costs reasonable and performance snappy!
