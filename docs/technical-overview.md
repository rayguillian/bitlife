# BitLife AI Technical Overview

## Current Technical Decisions

1. **AI Implementation Strategy**
   - Hybrid approach with 3 tiers:
     - Tier 1: Template-based events (90% of gameplay)
     - Tier 2: AI-enhanced templates (8% of gameplay)
     - Tier 3: Pure AI generation (2% of gameplay)
   - Cost/performance optimization with clear tradeoffs
   - NPC memory system combining structured data with AI generation

2. **Core Systems**
   - Four foundational AI systems:
     - Intelligent NPC ecosystem
     - Procedural storytelling engine
     - Advanced decision impact system
     - Living world simulation
   - RPG-style progression with skill trees and archetypes
   - Multi-generational gameplay mechanics

3. **Event System**
   - TypeScript-based type definitions for events
   - JSON schema validation for content
   - Version control with migration paths
   - Conditional logic system for event triggering

4. **Information Architecture**
   - React/Typescript frontend with Firebase backend
   - Eight main UI sections with clear navigation
   - Six AI backend services for different functions
   - Content organized into JSON files

5. **Development Timeline**
   - Three-phase rollout:
     - Phase 1: Core game loop
     - Phase 2: Basic AI integration
     - Phase 3: Advanced NPC systems
   - Risk-managed approach with fallback options

## Architecture Gaps

1. **Technical Debt Risks**
   - No clear documentation on template system evolution
   - Missing detailed API contracts between frontend and AI services

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - No mention of testing emergent AI behaviors
   - Need validation framework for AI-generated content

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - No benchmarks for event processing throughput
   - Missing fallback mechanisms for AI service outages

4. **Content Pipeline**
   - Undefined process for content updates and versioning
   - No tooling for content creators to manage templates

## Phase 1 Priorities

1. **Core Game Loop**
   - Basic event system with template-based events
   - Character creation and stat management
   - Simple choice/consequence mechanics

2. **Minimum Viable UI**
   - Story window with choices
   - Character stats panel
   - Basic navigation

3. **Foundation Systems**
   - Firebase integration for state management
   - Content loading system
   - Basic save/load functionality

## Key System Dependencies

1. **Critical Path Dependencies**

     A --> C[Decision Impact]
     B --> D[Cascade Effects]
     C --> D
     D --> E[World Simulation]
   ```

2. **Content Dependencies**
   - Need basic event templates before AI enhancement
   - Require trait definitions before personality system

3. **Technical Dependencies**
   - Firebase must be operational before AI integration
   - Content validation needed before production deployment
