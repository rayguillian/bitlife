Phase 1: Foundation (Start Here)

Basic Game Loop - Story window, choices, stat updates
Simple Event Generator - Basic template-based events without AI
Character/World State Management - Firebase integration, save/load
Core UI Components - Dashboard, character panel, basic navigation

Why start here? You need the fundamental game mechanics working before you can test if NPCs feel "alive." Plus, this gives you a playable prototype quickly.
Phase 2: AI Integration

Narrative Writer - AI-generated story text (easiest AI component to implement and test)
Decision Impact Engine - How choices affect stats and world state
Basic NPC System - Simple NPCs without memory (just reactions)

Phase 3: The Magic (NPC Memory Engine)

NPC Memory Engine - Now you have context to test it properly
NPC Goal Engine - NPCs pursuing their own objectives
Cascade Effect System - Social ripples through your established NPC network

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Order Makes Sense
Early Validation: You'll have a playable game in weeks, not months. You can test if the core concept is fun before investing in complex AI.
Technical Dependencies: The NPC memory engine needs:

Working event system (to create memories)
Functioning NPCs (to remember things)
Time progression (for memories to matter)
Relationship system (for emotional context)

Risk Management: If AI proves too expensive/complex, you still have a solid BitLife-style game as fallback.
Team Onboarding: Developers can learn the codebase with simpler systems before tackling complex AI.
ðŸ§ª Specific First Sprint Recommendation
Week 1-2: Minimal Viable Game Loop
- Character creation (basic stats)
- One story event with 2-3 choices
- Choice affects one stat
- Save/load character state
- Basic UI shell
Week 3-4: Content System
- Template-based events (20-30 basic scenarios)
- Age progression
- Simple career/education paths
- Death conditions
This gives you something playable to show stakeholders while you build toward the revolutionary AI features.
The NPC memory engine will be transformative, but only after you have a solid foundation to showcase its power.
