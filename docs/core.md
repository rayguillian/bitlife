Core Vision
Transform BitLife into a deeply immersive, AI-driven life simulation that combines the accessibility of mobile gaming with the narrative depth of RPGs like Pok√©mon and Zelda. Every character lives their own life with memories, goals, and evolving relationships.
üß† AI-Powered Core Systems
1. Intelligent NPC Ecosystem
Dynamic Personality System:

Each NPC has predispositions based on Big Five personality traits (OCEAN)
Custom traits: vengeful, ambitious, romantic, loyal, rebellious
Memory system that stores emotional events with weight and context
NPCs form opinions, hold grudges, and build deep affection over time

Emotional Memory System:

NPCs don't just remember events, but how those events made them feel
Emotional experiences create realistic personality drift over time
Trauma, joy, betrayal, and love actually change who they become
Long-term character development that mirrors real psychological growth

Cascade Effect Engine:

Your actions ripple through social networks with realistic consequences
Help someone get a job, and they might later help their friend, who becomes your doctor during a crisis

Butterfly effect mechanics where small kindnesses or slights compound over time

AI-Generated Life Mysteries:

The AI creates overarching mysteries or family secrets that unfold over decades
Clues scattered through seemingly random encounters and conversations
Hidden connections between NPCs revealed through careful observation
Personal mysteries: adoption secrets, inheritance puzzles, criminal cover-ups

Behavioral AI:

NPCs pursue their own goals: career advancement, relationships, revenge, creativity
