# Lifelike Project Plan

## Project Vision
Create an AI-driven life simulation game where:
- Every NPC has memory, personality, and personal journey
- Player choices create ripple effects across decades
- Emergent storytelling powered by generative AI
- Multi-generational gameplay with evolutionary traits

## Development Phases

```

## Team Structure

### Phase 1 Team (6 Members)
1. **Technical:**
   - 2x React/TypeScript Developers
   - 1 Firebase/Backend Engineer
   - 1 AI Specialist

2. **Creative:**
   - 1 Game Designer
   - 1 UX Designer

### Phase 2 Expansion (+3 Members)
- Additional AI Engineer

- QA Engineer

## Key Metrics

### Development Milestones
| Milestone | Target Date | Success Criteria |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| MVP Prototype | 2025-09-01 | Core game loop functional |
| Alpha | 2026-01-01 | Basic AI integration complete |
| Beta | 2026-07-01 | NPC memory system operational |
| Release | 2026-12-01 | Full feature set implemented |

### Performance Targets
- Mobile: <500MB RAM usage
- AI Response: <2s for 95% of requests
- Offline: Core gameplay functions without internet

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **AI Performance:**
   - Mitigation: Phased rollout, edge computing

2. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Mitigation: Optimistic UI updates, conflict resolution

3. **Content Scaling:**
   - Mitigation: Template-based approach with AI enhancement

## Next Steps
1. Assemble Phase 1 team
2. Establish development environment
3. Begin core systems implementation
4. Create content pipeline framework
